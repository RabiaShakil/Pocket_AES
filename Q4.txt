This encryption scheme has several security flaws and is not suitable for secure data encryption

Fixed Block Size: Using a fixed block size of 16 bits (2 characters) for encryption can be problematic. 
If the plaintext has repeating patterns or structures, they will also show up as repeating patterns in the ciphertext, which can be exploited by attackers.

Padding with Null Bytes: Padding with null bytes (00 hex) is not a secure padding scheme. 

Lack of Authentication: The scheme doesn't provide any means of ensuring the integrity of the data.
An attacker could modify the ciphertext, and the recipient would have no way to detect the tampering.

Encrypting each block of text separately using the same key is highly insecure.
Identical plaintext blocks will produce identical ciphertext blocks, which can leak information about the underlying data.
An attacker can exploit this to gain insights into the content.
In short, the encryption scheme lacks basic security.
